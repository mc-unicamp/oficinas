# Versum Translator

Versum is a narrative scripting language derived from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), having narrative structures inspired in [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md). All cases created in Harena are represented in Versum and translated (by this translator) to a **Versum Object Representation** as well as to the HTML that is rendered in the browser. This translator also runs backward, producing a Versum Script from the Versum Object Representation.

The syntax reference and the respective regular expressions adopted by this translator are documented the [Versum Syntax  and Object Representation](https://github.com/datasci4health/harena-docs/blob/master/versum/syntax.md).
